LionFire.Behaviors
==================

My first dabbling with behavior trees.

I ripped this out of a project I'm working on in case it is useful to others or sparks discussion.

This code is working (in my project) and compiles but not reviewed, or cleaned up, and still with some design up in the air, so excuse the mess.
